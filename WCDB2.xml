In order to receive it, the IMF instead of collateral it will require that Egypt implement economic reforms usually in the form of the unpopular austerity measures to cut Egypt's deficit. This translates into a cut in spending on public benefits, social services and development projects. It also comes with an increase in taxes on items such as food, alcohol and cigarettes and petroleum derived products which also include gasoline and cause higher fees for public services including transportation.</li>

Genetic research indicates that HIV originated in west-central Africa during the early twentieth century. AIDS was first recognized by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in 1981 and its cause—HIV infection—was identified in the early part of the decade. Since its discovery, AIDS has caused nearly 30 million deaths (as of 2009). As of 2010, approximately 34 million people are living with HIV globally. AIDS is considered a pandemic—a disease outbreak which is present over a large area and is actively spreading.
HIV/AIDS has had a great impact on society, both as an illness and as a source of discrimination. The disease also has significant economic impacts. There are many misconceptions about HIV/AIDS such as the belief that it can be transmitted by casual non-sexual contact. The disease has also become subject to many controversies involving religion.
AIDS stigma exists around the world in a variety of ways, including ostracism, rejection, discrimination and avoidance of HIV infected people; compulsory HIV testing without prior consent or protection of confidentiality; violence against HIV infected individuals or people who are perceived to be infected with HIV; and the quarantine of HIV infected individuals. Stigma-related violence or the fear of violence prevents many people from seeking HIV testing, returning for their results, or securing treatment, possibly turning what could be a manageable chronic illness into a death sentence and perpetuating the spread of HIV.</li>
		</HumanImpact>
		<EconomicImpact>
			<li>Economic research helps to estimate the effects of HIV/AIDS on the African economy and the cost effectiveness of prevention and treatment programmes
Economic theory predicts that HIV/AIDS reduces labour supply and productivity, reduces exports, and increases imports
The pandemic has already reduced average national economic growth rates by 2-4% a year across Africa
Prevention and treatment programmes and economic measures such as targeted training in skills needed in key industries will limit the economic effects of HIV/AIDS
HIV/AIDS affects the economics of both individuals and countries. The gross domestic product of the most affected countries has decreased due to the lack of human capital. Without proper nutrition, health care and medicine, large numbers of people die from AIDS-related complications. They will not only be unable to work, but will also require significant medical care. It is estimated that as of 2007 there were 12 million AIDS orphans.
By affecting mainly young adults, AIDS reduces the taxable population, in turn reducing the resources available for public expenditures such as education and health services not related to AIDS resulting in increasing pressure for the state's finances and slower growth of the economy. This causes a slower growth of the tax base, an effect that is reinforced if there are growing expenditures on treating the sick, training (to replace sick workers), sick pay and caring for AIDS orphans. This is especially true if the sharp increase in adult mortality shifts the responsibility and blame from the family to the government in caring for these orphans.
At the household level, AIDS causes both loss of income and increased spending on healthcare. A study in Côte d'Ivoire showed that households with an HIV/AIDS patient, spent twice as much on medical expenses as other households. This additional expenditure also leaves less income to spend on education and other personal or family investment.</li>
		</EconomicImpact>
		<ResourcesNeeded>
			<li>In many developing countries, high HIV rates are over-burdening already fragile health systems. As these health sectors struggle to provide basic health services, they must now also make HIV/AIDS prevention, services, and care available. To contain the spread and minimize the impact of HIV/AIDS, several global initiatives are making large amounts of financial and medical resources available. However, without efficient health systems, their impact will be limited.
Consistent condom use reduces the risk of HIV transmission by approximately 80% over the long term. When condoms are used consistently by a couple in which one person is infected, the rate of HIV infection is less than 1% per year. There is some evidence to suggest that female condoms may provide an equivalent level of protection. Application of a vaginal gel containing tenofovir (a reverse transcriptase inhibitor) immediately before sex seems to reduce infection rates by approximately 40% among African women
Circumcision in Sub-Saharan Africa &quot;reduces the acquisition of HIV by heterosexual men by between 38% and 66% over 24 months&quot;. Based on these studies, the World Health Organization and UNAIDS both recommended male circumcision as a method of preventing female-to-male HIV transmission in 2007. Whether it protects against male-to-female transmission is disputed and whether it is of benefit in developed countries and among men who have sex with men is undetermined. Some experts fear that a lower perception of vulnerability among circumcised men may cause more sexual risk-taking behavior, thus negating its preventive effects.</li>

There is currently no cure or effective HIV vaccine. Treatment consists of high active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) which slows progression of the disease[113] and as of 2010 more than 6.6 million people were taking them in low and middle income countries.[7] Treatment also includes preventive and active treatment of opportunistic infections.
Programs encouraging sexual abstinence do not appear to affect subsequent HIV risk. Evidence for a benefit from peer education is equally poor. Comprehensive sexual education provided at school may decrease high risk behavior. A substantial minority of young people continues to engage in high-risk practices despite knowing about HIV/AIDS, underestimating their own risk of becoming infected with HIV. It is not known whether treating other sexually transmitted infections is effective in preventing HIV.</li>

			<li>There was a general lowering in quality of life in many countries around the world. The recession left many businesses in dire straights requiring termination of many employees in most industries. From losing their jobs and a lack of hiring, most of the people whom were laid off were unable to find new jobs and therefore were unable to provide for their families.</li>
		</HumanImpact>
		<EconomicImpact>
			<li>Across the world many countries noticed declines in their GDP. In Europe and Asia, there were sharp declines in industrial output. Beginning around 2010, many countries started began to improve their situations, but most countries have not returned to there previous levels of prosperity. In some countries this is unrealistic because of their artificially high levels of economic prosperity. Ukraine, Argentina, and Jamaica are frequently considered the countries to have been most severely affected by the recession. Ireland, Russia, Mexico, Hungary, the Baltic States, United States and United Kingdom were also deeply affected and most have not completely return to their prior states of economic stability. </li>

		<History>
			<li>After the League of Nations failed to prevent World War II (1939–1945), there was widespread recognition that humankind could not afford a third world war. Therefore, the United Nations was established to replace the flawed League of Nations in 1945 in order to maintain international peace and promote cooperation in solving international economic, social, and humanitarian problems. The earliest concrete plan for a new world organization was begun under the aegis of the U.S. State Department in 1939. Franklin D. Roosevelt first coined the term 'United Nations' as a term to describe the Allied countries. The term was first officially used on 1 January 1942, when 26 governments signed the Atlantic Charter, pledging to continue the war effort. On 25 April 1945, the UN Conference on International Organization began in San Francisco, attended by 50 governments and a number of non-governmental organizations involved in drafting the United Nations Charter. The UN officially came into existence on 24 October 1945 upon ratification of the Charter by the five then-permanent members of the Security Council—France, the Republic of China, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom and the United States—and by a majority of the other 46 signatories. The first meetings of the General Assembly, with 51 nations represented, and the Security Council, took place in Methodist Central Hall Westminster in London beginning 6 January 1946.
The organization was based at the Sperry Gyroscope Corporation's facility in Lake Success, New York, from 1946–1952, before moving to the United Nations Headquarters building in Manhattan upon its completion.
Since its creation, there has been controversy and criticism of the United Nations. In the United States, an early opponent of the UN was the John Birch Society, which began a &quot;get US out of the UN&quot; campaign in 1959, charging that the UN's aim was to establish a &quot;One World Government&quot;. After the Second World War, the French Committee of National Liberation was late to be recognized by the US as the government of France, and so the country was initially excluded from the conferences that aimed at creating the new organization. Charles de Gaulle criticized the UN, famously calling it a machin (&quot;contraption&quot;), and was not convinced that a global security alliance would help maintain world peace, preferring direct defence treaties between countries.</li>

			<li>The World Health Organization (WHO) is a specialized agency of the United Nations (UN) that is concerned with international public health. It was established on 7 April 1948, with headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland, and is a member of the United Nations Development Group. Its predecessor, the Health Organization, was an agency of the League of Nations.
The constitution of the World Health Organization had been signed by all 61 countries of the United Nations by 22 July 1946, with the first meeting of the World Health Assembly finishing on 24 July 1948. It incorporated the Office International d'Hygiène Publique and the League of Nations Health Organization. Since its creation, WHO has been responsible for playing a leading role in the eradication of smallpox. Its current priorities include communicable diseases, in particular, HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis; the mitigation of the effects of non-communicable diseases; sexual and reproductive health, development, and aging; nutrition, food security and healthy eating; occupational health; substance abuse; and drive the development of reporting, publications, and networking. WHO is responsible for the World Health Report, a leading international publication on health, the worldwide World Health Survey, and World Health Day (7th-April of every Year).</li>

		<History>
			<li>The Salvation Army was founded in London's East End in 1865 by one-time Methodist Reform Church minister William Booth and his wife Catherine. Originally, Booth named the organization the East London Christian Mission. The name The Salvation Army developed from an incident on 19–20 May. William Booth was dictating a letter to his secretary George Scott Railton and said, &quot;We are a volunteer army.&quot; Bramwell Booth heard his father and said, &quot;Volunteer! I'm no volunteer, I'm a regular!&quot; Railton was instructed to cross out the word &quot;volunteer&quot; and substitute the word &quot;salvation&quot;. The Salvation Army was modeled after the military, with its own flag (or colours) and its own hymns, often with words set to popular and folkloric tunes sung in the pubs. Booth and the other soldiers in &quot;God's Army&quot; would wear the Army's own uniform, for meetings and ministry work. He became the &quot;General&quot; and his other ministers were given appropriate ranks as &quot;officers&quot;. Other members became &quot;soldiers&quot;.
When William Booth became known as the General, Catherine was known as the &quot;Mother of The Salvation Army&quot;. William preached to the poor, and Catherine spoke to the wealthy, gaining financial support for their work. She also acted as a religious minister, which was unusual at the time; the Foundation Deed of the Christian Mission states that women had the same rights to preach as men. William Booth described the organisation's approach: &quot;The three ‘S's’ best expressed the way in which the Army administered to the 'down and outs': first, soup; second, soap; and finally, salvation.&quot;
In 1880, the Salvation Army started its work in three other countries: Australia, Ireland, and the United States. It was not always an official Officer of The Salvation Army who started the Salvation Army in a new country; sometimes Salvationists emigrated to countries and started operating as &quot;the Salvation Army&quot; on their own authority. When the first official officers arrived in Australia and the United States, they found groups of Salvationists already waiting for them.
The Salvation Army's main converts were at first alcoholics, morphine addicts, prostitutes and other &quot;undesirables&quot; unwelcome in polite Christian society, which helped prompt the Booths to start their own church. The Booths did not include the use of sacraments (mainly baptism and Holy Communion) in the Army's form of worship, believing that many Christians had come to rely on the outward signs of spiritual grace rather than on grace itself. Other beliefs are that its members should completely refrain from drinking alcohol (Holy Communion is not practiced), smoking, taking illegal drugs and gambling. Its soldiers wear a uniform tailored to the country in which they work; the uniform can be white, grey, navy, fawn and are even styled like a sari in some areas. Any member of the public is welcome to attend their meetings.
Chief of the Staff of The Salvation Army, Commissioner André Cox, is currently acting as the leader of the Salvation Army.
As the Salvation Army grew rapidly in the late 19th century, it generated opposition in England. Opponents, grouped under the name of the Skeleton Army, disrupted Salvation Army meetings and gatherings, with tactics such as throwing rocks, bones, rats, and tar as well as physical assaults on members of The Salvation Army. Much of this was led by pub owners who were losing business because of the Army's opposition to alcohol and targeting of the frequenters of saloons and public houses.
The Salvation Army's reputation in the United States improved as a result of its disaster relief efforts following the Galveston Hurricane of 1900 and the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. The establishment of Victorian bell-ringers raising charity today &quot;helps complete the American portrait of Christmas&quot;, with over 25,000 volunteers taking up kettles over the holiday period in the U.S. alone. The church remains a highly visible and sometimes controversial presence in many parts of the world.
In 1994, the Chronicle of Philanthropy, an industry publication, released the results of the largest study of charitable and non-profit organisation popularity and credibility. The study showed that The Salvation Army was ranked as the 4th &quot;most popular charity/non-profit in America&quot; of over 100 charities researched with 47% of Americans over the age of 12 choosing Love and Like A Lot for The Salvation Army.</li>

			<li>With the intent to film a documentary about the War in Darfur, college students, Jason Russell, Bobby Bailey and Laren Poole traveled to Africa in 2003.[6] Russell had recently graduated from film school at the University of Southern California, and after witnessing gunmen shoot at the truck in front of him while driving in northern Uganda, he discovered Joseph Kony and the Lord's Resistance Army.[7] After the incident, the group decided instead to focus on the civil war affecting the region. After returning home to the United States, the group created a documentary entitled Invisible Children: The Rough Cut, which aims to expose the plight of child soldiers and night commuters of northern Uganda.[8] The film was originally shown to the group's friends and family, but eventually reached millions of people.[8] The three men believed that the world was unaware of the conditions in Uganda and the plight of the children they met there.
The young men set out on a mission to expose what they had witnessed in Uganda, showing screenings of their film at hundreds of high schools, colleges and churches throughout the United States. In 2004 the group founded Invisible Children, Inc as a non-profit charitable organization. They solicit donations and sell merchandise, such as bracelets, t-shirts and posters, to raise money for their cause. The money they raise is used, in part, to produce awareness films, and for humanitarian aid to northern Uganda.
Invisible Children, Inc. supporters in Portland, Oregon participating in a Global Night Commute on April 29, 2006. The participants sleep in a public place to simulate children in Uganda sleeping in a city center to avoid capture from the Lord's Resistance Army.
In April 2007, the group organized an event called &quot;Displace Me&quot;, in which 67,000 activists throughout the United States slept in the streets in makeshift cardboard villages, hoping to raise awareness about those displaced by the Ugandan government. Later in 2007, American rock band Fall Out Boy filmed a music video for the song &quot;I'm Like a Lawyer with the Way I'm Always Trying to Get You Off (Me &amp; You)&quot; in Uganda after hearing of the organization's cause. Fall Out Boy originally intended to create a documentary-style film, but decided to focus on a love story between two Ugandan children, opining that the treatment &quot;seemed a lot more dangerous and compelling. I mean, have you ever seen a love story between Ugandan people — especially with a rock band — on 'TRL'?&quot; Invisible Children co-founder Bobby Bailey referred to the video as &quot;groundbreaking&quot;.
Although the LRA left Uganda in 2006 after failed peace negotiations with the government, in March 2012, Invisible Children, Inc. continued to create new awareness programs. In May 2010, President Barack Obama signed the &quot;Lord's Resistance Army Disarmament and Northern Uganda Recovery Act&quot;. Invisible Children was one of the advocacy groups that influenced the passing of the bill. Representatives of Invisible Children and other groups were present in the Oval Office when the President Barack Obama signed the law. The President told the people in attendance &quot;We have seen your reporting, your websites, your blogs, and your video postcards—you have made the plight of the children visible to us all.&quot;
In March 2012, Invisible Children began an internet video campaign called Kony 2012. The premise of the campaign was to heighten awareness of the actions of Kony and the LRA in order to put further pressure on the U.S. government to intervene militarily in Central Africa. The campaign focused on &quot;making Kony famous&quot; in order to awaken people to his crimes and the pressure the government into military actions. The production value of the film was praised and it was suggested that the methodology used would be a trend in activism in the future. The video went viral, reaching more than 40 million views in three days after being tweeted by celebrities such as Rihanna, Oprah Winfrey, and Ryan Seacrest. Immediately following the release and success of the internet films in the Kony 2012 program, criticism of the organization's activities and finances surfaced.</li>
