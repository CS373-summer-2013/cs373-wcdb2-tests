            <Summary>
                Malaria is a life threatening illness and a major cause of death worldwide. It exists in tropical and subtropical climates and still infects hundred of millions of people annually. It is a major drain on productivity of heavily infected nations and has a major economic impact. Nations have successfully eliminated malaria with wide use of insecticides in the past, such as DDT. Global eradication of the four types of malaria is a major 
                goal of several globaliazed communal orginizations.

            <Summary>
                Extensive diamond deposits were located in late 2006 around Marange, Zimbabwe. The government quickly moved in and displaced local residents and miners. By 2008 the Zimbabwean military was practicing many humans right violations such as forced labor, torture, and mass killings to maintain its grasp. The United Nation's Kimberly Process dispatched a reviewer in 2009 to inspect claims of widespread violations and ultimately came to a
                compromise with the Zimbabwean government.

            <Summary>The 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake was an undersea megathrust earthquake that occurred at 00:58:53 UTC on Sunday, 26 December 2004, with an epicentre off the west coast of Sumatra, Indonesia. The quake itself is known by the scientific community as the Sumatra earthquake.The resulting tsunami was given various names, including the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, South Asian tsunami, Indonesian tsunami, and the Boxing Day tsunami.
The earthquake was caused when the Indian Plate was subducted by the Burma Plate and triggered a series of devastating tsunamis along the coasts of most landmasses bordering the Indian Ocean, killing over 230,000 people in fourteen countries, and inundating coastal communities with waves up to 30 meters (98 ft) high. It was one of the deadliest natural disasters in recorded history. Indonesia was the hardest-hit country, followed by Sri Lanka,India, and Thailand.
With a magnitude of Mw 9.1, it is the third largest earthquake ever recorded on a seismograph. The earthquake had the longest duration of faulting ever observed, between 8.3 and 10 minutes. It caused the entire planet to vibrate as much as 1 centimetre (0.4 inches)and triggered other earthquakes as far away as Alaska. Its epicentre was between Simeulue and mainland Indonesia.</Summary>

            <Summary>In pursuance of an appeal by the then Prime Minister, Pt. Jawaharlal Nehru in January, 1948, the Prime Minister's National Relief Fund (PMNRF) was established with public contributions to assist displaced persons from Pakistan. The resources of the PMNRF are now utilized primarily to render immediate relief to families of those killed in natural calamities like floods, cyclones and earthquakes, etc. and to the victims of the major accidents and riots. Assistance from PMNRF is also rendered for medical treatment like heart surgeries, kidney transplantation, cancer treatment, etc. The fund consists entirely of public contributions and does not get any budgetary support. The corpus of the fund is invested with banks in fixed deposits. Disbursements are made with the approval of the Prime Minister.</Summary>

        <History>
            <li>The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) is a United Nations (UN) body formed in December 1991 by General Assembly Resolution 46/182. The resolution was designed to strengthen the UN's response to complex emergencies and natural disasters by creating the Department of Humanitarian Affairs (DHA), and replacing the Office of the United Nations Disaster Relief Coordinator, which had been formed in 1972. In 1998, due to reorganisation, DHA merged into the OCHA and was designed to be the UN focal point on major disasters. Its mandate was expanded to also include the coordination of humanitarian response, policy development and humanitarian advocacy. </li>
