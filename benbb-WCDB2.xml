			<li>An estimated three million people were affected by the quake. The highest reliable death count was estimated at 220,000. Haitian government estimates were higher.
While the vast majority of casualties were Haitian civilians, the dead included aid workers, embassy staff, foreign tourists—and a number of public figures, including Archbishop of Port-au-Prince Monsignor Joseph Serge Miot, aid worker Zilda Arns and officials in the Haitian government, including opposition leader Michel &quot;Micha&quot; Gaillard. Also killed were a number of well-known Haitian musicians[104] and sports figures, including thirty members of the Fédération Haïtienne de Football. At least 85 United Nations personnel working with MINUSTAH were killed, among them the Mission Chief, Hédi Annabi, his deputy, Luiz Carlos da Costa., and police commissioner Douglas Coates. Around 200 guests were killed in the collapse of the Hôtel Montana in Port-au-Prince.</li>

			<li>Hundreds of thousands of buildings plummeted to the ground including homes, the presidential palace, and even the United Nations Peacekeeping Mission.  The earthquake resulted in 105,000 homes being destroyed, causing $2.3 billion in damage and the nation being covered in rubble (Haiti). The government of Haiti estimated that 250,000 residences and 30,000 commercial buildings had collapsed or were severely damaged.</li>
		</EconomicImpact>
		<ResourcesNeeded>
			<li>Many countries responded to the appeals and launched fund-raising efforts, as well as sending search and rescue teams. The neighbouring Dominican Republic was the first country to give aid to Haiti,[111] sending water, food and heavy-lifting machinery.[115] The hospitals in the Dominican Republic were made available; a combined effort of the Airports Department (DA), together with the Dominican Naval Auxiliaries, the UN and other parties formed the Dominican-Haitian Aerial Support Bridge, making the main Dominican airports available for support operations to Haiti. The Dominican website FlyDominicanRepublic.com made available to the internet, daily updates on airport information and news from the operations center on the Dominican side. The Dominican emergency team assisted more than 2,000 injured people, while the Dominican Institute of Telecommunications (Indotel) helped with the restoration of some telephone services.The Dominican Red Cross coordinated early medical relief in conjunction with the International Red Cross.The government sent eight mobile medical units along with 36 doctors including orthopaedic specialists, traumatologists, anaesthetists, and surgeons. In addition, 39 trucks carrying canned food were dispatched, along with 10 mobile kitchens and 110 cooks capable of producing 100,000 meals per day</li>

			<li>From 12 January, the International Committee of the Red Cross, which has been working in Haiti since 1994, focused on bringing emergency assistance to victims of the catastrophe, in close cooperation with its partners within the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, particularly the Haitian Red Cross and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.
Canadians were able to donate through the Humanitarian Coalition which distributed funds to partner organizations working in the field. During this time the Humanitarian Coalition raised over C$15 Million.
The Netherlands sponsored a project, called Radio555. The Dutch radio channels 3FM, Radio 538 and Radio Veronica all broadcast under the name of Radio555, funded by a contribution of €80 million.
Immediately following the earthquake, Real Medicine Foundation began providing medical staffing, in-kind medical supplies and strategic coordination to help meet the surging needs of the health crisis on the ground. Working in close partnership with other relief organizations, Real Medicine organized deployments of volunteer medical specialists to meet the needs of partner hospitals and clinics at the Haiti–Dominican Republic border and in Port-au-Prince, provided direct funding, medical supplies and pharmaceuticals to local health facilities and partner hospitals, provided advisory services and coordination to local health facilities, including physical therapy support, and coordinated mobile health outreaches, field clinics and food supplies to outlying villages overlooked in the relief effort.</li>

			<li>Twelve people were killed at a multiplex Cinemark theater in Aurora Colorado during the midnight screening of the film The Dark Knight Rises. 
This incident was considered the deadliest shooting since The Columbine massacre on April 20, 1999. 
Several other incidents followed this one at other theaters where several other men were arrested for acts of violence or attempting to carry through with an act of violence. 
The Presidential Candidates at the time, Barrack Obama and Mitt Romney, suspended campaign advertising and visited victims at Hospitals. 
Actor Christian Bale along with other sports teams visited several victims and expressed their condolences. 
There was a great fear that similar incidents would occur in cinemas across the United States and the world resulting in an increase in security in cinemas throughout the country. 
This once again brought the issue of gun control to the surface of news and politics. </li>
		</HumanImpact>
		<EconomicImpact>
			<li>The Organization The Community First Foundation received substantial donations from Warner Bros. to aid the victims of the shooting. 
The theater where the incident occurred was shut down for months before reopening on January 2013, resulting in a great loss for the theater owners. 
Funeral expenses incurred by the victim's families was paid for by Cinemark. Gun sales in Colorado, Washington, Florida, and several other states grew tremendously after the incident along with an increase in background checks. 
Resources Needed: 
Cinemas and theaters around the world began hiring more employees to fill out the roles needed in their security increase. 
Companies associated with the film and theater, Warner Bros. and Cinemark, donated a great amount of time to aid the families of the victims. </li>

			<li>The Government first used a Strata 950 model raise borer drilling rig to create an escape shaft but this plan was halted due to the danger falling rock debris. 
They then used a Schramm Inc. T130XD air core drill, to widen one of the holes created by the previously used drill rig but was unfortunately wrecked upon hitting a metal bar in an old working, which was then followed by wearing out of the second drill. 
The third and last attempt involved a Canadian made RIG-421 oil drilling rig which was able to drill large deep holes at faster rate than the mining drills. 
Cooperation and resources of companies and individuals came from around the world such as Latin America, South America, United States and Canada, with developmental aid coming from NASA specialists. </li>

		<History>
			<li>fter the League of Nations failed to prevent World War II (1939–1945), there was widespread recognition that humankind could not afford a third world war. Therefore, the United Nations was established to replace the flawed League of Nations in 1945 in order to maintain international peace and promote cooperation in solving international economic, social, and humanitarian problems. The earliest concrete plan for a new world organization was begun under the aegis of the U.S. State Department in 1939. Franklin D. Roosevelt first coined the term 'United Nations' as a term to describe the Allied countries. The term was first officially used on 1 January 1942, when 26 governments signed the Atlantic Charter, pledging to continue the war effort. On 25 April 1945, the UN Conference on International Organization began in San Francisco, attended by 50 governments and a number of non-governmental organizations involved in drafting the United Nations Charter. The UN officially came into existence on 24 October 1945 upon ratification of the Charter by the five then-permanent members of the Security Council—France, the Republic of China, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom and the United States—and by a majority of the other 46 signatories. The first meetings of the General Assembly, with 51 nations represented, and the Security Council, took place in Methodist Central Hall Westminster in London beginning 6 January 1946.
The organization was based at the Sperry Gyroscope Corporation's facility in Lake Success, New York, from 1946–1952, before moving to the United Nations Headquarters building in Manhattan upon its completion.
Since its creation, there has been controversy and criticism of the United Nations. In the United States, an early opponent of the UN was the John Birch Society, which began a &quot;get US out of the UN&quot; campaign in 1959, charging that the UN's aim was to establish a &quot;One World Government&quot;. After the Second World War, the French Committee of National Liberation was late to be recognized by the US as the government of France, and so the country was initially excluded from the conferences that aimed at creating the new organization. Charles de Gaulle criticized the UN, famously calling it a machin (&quot;contraption&quot;), and was not convinced that a global security alliance would help maintain world peace, preferring direct defence treaties between countries.</li>

Became notoriously known in the mineral-rich region and has had 8 workers die while working in their mines along with a number of fines for safety breaching.
The San Jose Mine which is owned by the company was closed in 2007 when relatives of deceased workers sued the company but was reopened in 2008 even though it failed to comply with regulations.
The company has a history of ignoring warnings and worker lawsuits of unsafe working conditions and many believe that were it not for this the event could have been avoided.</li>

		<History>
			<li>It is one of the largest and most active Islamist terrorist organizations in South Asia operating mainly from Pakistan.
Founded in 1990 by Hafez Saeed, Abdullah Azzam, and Zafar Iqbal in Afghansitan's Kunar province and gained prominence as an offshoot of a previously established preaching group.
In the early 2000's several countries including the United States and the UK declared the group a terrorist organization.
Main goal has been stated to be not only the destruction of the Indian republic but to annihilate Hinduism and Judaism throughout South Asia.
Is known for target military and civilian targets with the most notable events  being the 2001 Indian Parliament attack and the 2008 Mumbai attacks.
After the 2008 Mumbai attacks Pakistan was pressured by the US and India to launch operations against the group and while they have clamped down on the group it is suspected by many that they continue to support the group.</li>

It was created effective February 1, 2004 by House Bill 2292 of the 78th Texas Legislature (2003) as the first new agency in a major reorganization of Texas's health and human services system.[1] Prior to this time the agency had been called the Texas Department of Protective and Regulatory Services (PRS).[2][3] The change was made to help &quot;consolidate organizational structures and functions, eliminate duplicative administrative systems, and streamline processes and procedures that guide the delivery of health and human services to Texans.&quot;</li>

		<History>
			<li>The Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (FLDS Church, known to some as Mormon Fundamentalists) is one of the largest fundamentalist denominations[3][4] and one of the largest organizations in the United States whose members practice polygamy.[5] The FLDS Church emerged in the early twentieth century when its founding members left The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). The split occurred largely because of the LDS Church's suspension of the practice of polygamy and its decision to excommunicate its members who would continue the practice.The FLDS Church is estimated to have 6,000 - 10,000 members residing in the sister cities of Hildale, Utah and Colorado City, Arizona; Eldorado, Texas; Westcliffe, Colorado; Mancos, Colorado; Creston and Bountiful, British Columbia; and Pringle, South Dakota.[6] There are also developing communities near Benjamín Hill, Sonora (south of Nogales in the state of Sonora) and Ensenada, Baja California (south of Tijuana). n 2003, the church received increased attention from the state of Utah when police officer Rodney Holm, a member of the church, was convicted of unlawful sexual conduct with a 16- or 17-year-old and one count of bigamy for his marriage to and impregnation of plural wife Ruth Stubbs. The conviction was the first legal action against a member of the FLDS Church since the Short Creek raid.</li>
